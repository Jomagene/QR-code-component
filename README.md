## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

I've learned to use external font families and add some personalized and reusable classes. Here are some examples:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet" />
```

```css
.flex {
  display: flex;
}
.flex-center {
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
.size-288 {
  width: 288px;
  height: 288px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would explore using CSS Grid for more complex layouts and work on enhancing accessibility by adding ARIA roles and attributes.
